<h1 align="center"> SkyBlockSearcher </h1>

SkyBlockSearcher is a 1.8.9 Minecraft mod for Hypixel Skyblock used to search through an inventory: such as the auction house or an ender chest.

It adds a text box to the GUI of a chest, you write in it and it highlights the items that include the words you wrote, that includes enchantments, stats, item names.

Entering multiple inputs will only highlight items that match all of them. Separate each input with `;`. For example `soul eater v; smite vii; life steal iii` will only highlight items that include these enchants, (it can have other enchants as well). If any of the inputs are not matched then the item will not be highlighted.

The mod is best for Auction House since you can search through it and find the item you want with the enchant(s) you want. This is very useful for flippers that want to find the items with the enchants and stats they want quickly, as well as low ballers trying to find the price of an item similar to what they are buying.
