SkyBlockSearcher is a mod for searching through an inventory (Like the auction house or ender chest), it adds a text box to the GUI of a chest, you write in it and it highlights the items that include the words you wrote, that includes enchantments, stats, item names.
you can have multiple inputs and it will only highlight items with all the inputs. You write ';' between every input, so for example:

soul eater v; smite vii; life steal iii

that will only highlight items with those enchants, (it can have other enchants as well), if one they aren't there then it won't highlight it, it's best for Auction House since you can search through it and find the item you want with the enchant you want (really useful for flippers that want to find the items with the enchants and stats they want quickly, as well as lowballers trying to find an item similar to what they're buying quickly to get the price)
